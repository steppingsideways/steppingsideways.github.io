		A polite lineup at the post office can be beautiful. So can a happy, bustling crowd by the espresso pick-up counter, or a parking lot full of people waiting for the fire alarm to be turned off. Why endure disorder when you could relish it? When you hit an unexpected twist in the road, remember that dictionary definitions of “diversion” include “recreation” and “amusement”.
