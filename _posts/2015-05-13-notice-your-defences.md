		<p>When you hear a greeting or an invitation are you wary of an agenda - political, religious, economic, romantic? Notice what that wariness feels like in your mind and body today. When we avoid nuisance, we also avoid nuance. Can you honour your boundaries while fairly assessing each interaction?</p>
		<p>Bonus - if it’s safe, listen to a pitch all the way through to the end, even if you are quite certain you are uninterested. Practice saying ‘thanks but no thanks’ AFTER hearing a person out. It’s less comfortable at first, but quickly begins to feel more comfortable than shutting someone down off the top.</p>
