![Notice Your Defences: When you hear a greeting or an invitation are you wary of an agenda - political, religious, economic, romantic? Notice what that wariness feels like in your mind and body today. When we avoid nuisance, we also avoid nuance. Can you honour your boundaries while fairly assessing each interaction? Bonus - if it’s safe, listen to a pitch all the way through to the end, even if you are quite certain you are uninterested. Practice saying ‘thanks but no thanks’ AFTER hearing a person out. It’s less comfortable at first, but quickly begins to feel more comfortable than shutting someone down off the top.](https://github.com/steppingsideways/steppingsideways.github.io/blob/master/images/Medium_Sized_Images/notice_your_defences.png?raw=true){: .img-responsive .center-block .animated .fadeIn}
