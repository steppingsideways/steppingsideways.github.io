![Trust A Stranger: Since the early 1990s, crime has declined in North America, and current crime rates are approximately the same as those of the 1960s(Source - Wikipedia). Remember back in the good old days when you could ask someone you donâ€™t know for a quick hand, or you could walk alone at night? The good old days are today.](https://github.com/steppingsideways/steppingsideways.github.io/blob/master/images/Medium_Sized_Images/trust_a_stranger.png?raw=true){: .img-responsive .center-block .animated .fadeIn}
