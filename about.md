Stepping Sideways is a deck of cards designed to help us break out of mental habits and physical routines - habits and routines  which may be invisible to us and which may reinforce our isolation and stuck-ness. We use the cards when we want to manifest new outcomes in our urban environments.

The phrases on the cards point to actions, attitudes or perspectives that we should be able to adopt immediately and incorporate into our day without extensive pre-planning. We draw a single card from the shuffled pack or by clicking the "draw a card" button. The card is trusted for the entire day, even if its appropriateness is quite unclear...

The strategies on these cards are not based on peer-reviewed social science. They make no claim to effecting any one particular new outcome. They are intuitively-authored aphorisms - open to interpretation. They disrupt rather than prescribe.

Stepping Sideways is indebted to and modeled on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies">“Oblique Strategies”</a> - a deck of printed cards in a black container box created by musicians Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt. 

We are always interested in expanding the deck. Please email <a href="mailto:steppingsideways@gobaci.com ">steppingsideways@gobaci.com</a> with feedback or ideas for new cards.


* One final note:  Some people feel unsafe around strangers. Nothing in the "Stepping Sideways" deck should be taken as advising us to pursue interactions with people who prefer to be left alone. If someone doesn't smile back or reply to you, no big deal! Give them their space, and have your own great day.
