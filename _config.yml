  Stepping Sideways is a deck of cards designed to manifest new experiences by helping us break out of our mental habits and physical routines. Many of our habits and routines are invisible to us. Some of them may reinforce isolation and stuck-ness. Stepping Sideways introduces elements of chance, playfulness, and novelty to the mix.
